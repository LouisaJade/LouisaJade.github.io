My biggest interest is the ocean and all things marine science, though I also love our Rocky Mountains and will do anything to get outside anywhere. My plans for furthering my education currently include pursuing a masters in marine conservation after a two year gap year to save some money and gain some internship experience in the marine sector. Someday I hope to be doing anything and everything I can to protect the ocean and all it's inhabitants.

This last summer I had the opportunity to do some research in Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia. I learned about new marine field techniques that included snorkeling along transects, dropping quadrats and taking photos. I was also introduced to the world of coding using Primer7. I hope to go back and potentially pursue my masters somewhere in Australia. I also got to hold a koala!
