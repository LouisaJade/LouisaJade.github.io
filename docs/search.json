    "text": "My biggest interest is the ocean and all things marine science, though I also love our Rocky Mountains and will do anything to get outside anywhere. My plans for furthering my education currently include pursuing a masters in marine conservation after a two year gap year to save some money and gain some internship experience in the marine sector. Someday I hope to be doing anything and everything I can to protect the ocean and all it’s inhabitants.\n\n\n\nScuba diving the Great Barrier Reef (Summer 2024)\n\n\nThis last summer I had the opportunity to do some research in Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia. I learned about new marine field techniques that included snorkeling along transects, dropping quadrats and taking photos. I was also introduced to the world of coding using Primer7. I hope to go back and potentially pursue my masters somewhere in Australia. I also got to hold a koala!"

The final project was a creative website on an insect related to our major. My major at the time was marine biology and there are very few marine insects so I settled on one particular insect with little to no previous research done.\nEchthrodesis lamorali: Intertidal Parasitoid Wasp\n\n\n\nSpring 2024\n\nColorado State University - CO 301B - Writing in the Disciplines: Sciences\nIn the spring of 2024 I took a class at Colorado State University that focused on various forms of scientific writing.
